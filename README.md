# Life Matters
Life Matters is a Ambulance tracking system which helps the ambulance drivers get a clear path from traffic using this application. The system provides two user interfaces:

1. **Traffic Police Interface:** Allows traffic police to monitor ambulance routes via a map API and manage traffic lights.
2. **Ambulance Interface:** Ensures traffic lights stay green until the ambulance passes, facilitating a continuous green corridor to the destination.

## Project Goals

- Enable real-time tracking of ambulance routes.
- Automatically control traffic lights to prioritize ambulance movement.
